## Hello, I'm Nicolas Moccagatta ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„
I'm a seasoned Software Engineer with **over 7 years of experience in Full Stack Software Development**, specializing in Frontend Web Technologies. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the University of Buenos Aires, where I majored in Computer Science, I've had the privilege of contributing to various projects across different companies, from startups to industry giants like Mercado Libre, Medallia, and PayPal.

Throughout my career, I've developed a deep understanding of crafting user-centric experiences using technologies such as **React, Node, TypeScript, Redux, GraphQL, and more...** My involvement spans the entire software development lifecycle, from Discovery and Analysis to Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Monitoring and Maintenance. This comprehensive perspective ensures that I'm not only able to deliver solutions that meet user needs but also contribute effectively to the long-term success of projects.

While I take pride in my experience and skills, I remain committed to continuous learning and improvement. I'm eager to bring my expertise to a top tech company where I can collaborate with like-minded individuals and tackle new challenges that push the boundaries of innovation.
